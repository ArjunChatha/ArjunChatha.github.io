<p>Was Hester Prynne a Strong Female Character? Was Hester Prynne a feminist?</p>
<p class= "p6">Hester Prynne, a character in The Scarlet Letter, lived in a time where women were considered inferior to men. But Nathaniel Hawthorne made her unique. Hester Prynne was a strong female character who overcame challenges thrown at her by the rest of society, because of her sin, using her persistence and determination. Although Prynne defended herself with courage, she was not a feminist. A feminist is an advocate for women’s rights, but the suppression within the Puritan society prevented women from standing up for themselves. 
Hester Prynne’s strength was exemplified when she was being humiliated on the scaffold. Hawthorne wrote, “Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude,—each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts,—Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a disdainful smile” (Hawthorne 40). Prynne was determined not to let the humiliation in. She knew that once their comments truly affected her, she would portray herself to the town, as weak and it would leave her in an impossible situation. Furthermore, she could only win this battle if she remained strong in front of the crowd. At the same time it was impractical for her to assert against the town’s behaviour. Speaking out would have created graver consequences for herself that were undesirable. Her consequences could have been banishment, separation from Pearl, or even death. As she refrained from protesting against the towns actions, and simply defended herself, it showed that she wasn’t a feminist but a strong person of her time.
Hester Prynne’s strength also presented itself when she argued with the governor to keep Pearl. She exclaimed, “God gave me this child! He gave her, in all requital of all things else, which ye had taken from me...She is the Scarlet Letter, only capable of being loved...The power of retribution of my sin...Ye shall not take her! I will die first” (Hawthorne 77). She demonstrated her moral strength by standing up to the most powerful figure in the town. However, at the same time she exclaimed the internal struggle within her, wherein Pearl was both a blessing and a punishment for her sins. A feminist would never consider her only child to be a retribution from god. A feminist strives for equality. Dimmesdale was not viewed by the town as sinful even when he confessed his sins. Because of this, if Hester was a women's rights advocate she would not acknowledge that Pearl was a living sin. Thus, while Hester Prynne is strong in the face of adversity she is certainly not a feminist.  
Hester never objected to the Scarlet Letter, not even after Dimmesdale’s death. She believed that, “Here had been her sin; here, her sorrow; and here was yet to be her penitence. She had returned, therefore, resumed,—of her own free will, for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed it,—resumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale” (Hawthorne 197). Prynne continued to wear the Scarlet Letter long after anyone in the town required her to do so. Dimmesdale who was equally guilty of the same sin, was never publicly humiliated. Her punishment was unjust but she did not protest against and suffered it with courage. She never advocated for herself to avoid this punishment that fell unequally on her.
Hester Prynne faced hardships throughout her life, but she endured them with fortitude. She displayed her strength while defending herself on the scaffold, and while protecting Pearl. She suffered the punishments of her sin, but did not fight against their unjustness. Hester Prynne was a strong and courageous woman of her time.</p></body>
