    <h1>Welcome to Arjun's Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <h2> Here I showcase my accomplishments and goals from my 8th grade year.</h2>    
    <h3>Smart Goal:</h3>
    <p>My goal to improve is to my writing skills. I have started reading a lot, and I always make sure I learn my material. I make sure to listen in class and ask questions to help my understanding of the concept. I aslo practice annotating and writing paragraphs when I read at home so I can prepare more and be more confident at school.</p>

    
    
    <h3>Stretch:</h3>
    <p>My stretch was writing essays. My strecth has improved, but I am still inconstistent. In literature we wrote 2 essays for The Scarlett Letter, and out of 2, I performed well in  one and not so well in the other. In Social Studies I have written 2 and again I did well in one and not so well in one. In Spanish as well we had a writing task which I did well in. I notice that confidence plays a big role in my essay, and to raise my confidence I have to know the concept well. To do well, I have to ask questions in class, and make sure before I write my essay I know my material well. In my literature essay in which I di well in I pushed myslef to write what I believed, which then created stronger analysis and improved the writing quality of the essay.</p>
   
    <h3>Strength:</h3> 
    <p>My strength is annotating while reading. My strength has remained constant in most classes but in certain cases it has been slightly inconsistent. In literature I annotated The Odyssey and The Scarlet Letter, and that has my improved my writing in my final Scarlet Letter essay. In spanish we generally do not use annotations to comprehend the text and plot. I highlight all the words I dont know which helps me learn new vocabulary and prepare for the test. In math we take notes which always helps me understand new concepts and formulas. In social studies we annotate Give Me Liberty! and always do except for recently, I have been inconsistent and I will get back on track. Annotations always helped me learn about events, and I am glad we have the oppurtinity to do them.</p>    
 
    <h3>Mid-year Reflection Questions and Response:</h3> 
    <p>How broad is my friend group?</p>
    <p>My friend group is very broad. I am friends with most of the boys in the grade, and we never exclude anyone. To improve my social atmosphere, we encourage other kids from younger grade to play with us as well.</p> 
    <p>How have I contributed to our community this year?</p>
    <p>I have gone to Casa de Amistad. We go and teach younger kids and play games with them. It is a fun experience, and it is cool that I am teaching younger kids. Also seeing the joy on there faces when win the game is really funny.</p> 
    <p>Are you consistent with completing work on time?</p>
